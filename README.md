# openAAS_PropertyDemo
This repository delivers a small demonstrator for the property model and the message transmission with opc ua. The implementation is based on [open62541](http://open62541.org/).

The project can be compiled for a raspberry pi (Version B+). It implements a basic demo for a combined temperature and humidity sensor.
